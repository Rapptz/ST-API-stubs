# Sublime Text API Stubs

With LSP proper configured, you can have something like the following screenshot.

## How to use

I personally use this with [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) + `LSP-pyright` setup.

1. Install the [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) package via Package Control.
1. You have to copy those `.pyi` stub files from this repository to `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/typings/` directory.
1. Make your preferred LSP server able to "see" them.

   - If you use [LSP-pyright](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-pyright),
     configure the `python.analysis.extraPaths`:

     ```js
     {
         "settings": {
             "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
                 // my custom stubs
                 "$packages/../stubs",
                 // project's stubs
                 "$folder/typings",
                 // the followings come from the default settings
                 "$sublime_py_files_dir",
                 "$packages",
             ],
         },
     }
     ```

   - If you use [LSP-pyls](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-pyls),
     configure the `pyls.plugins.jedi.extra_paths`:

     ```js
     {
         "settings": {
             "pyls.plugins.jedi.extra_paths": [
                 // my custom stubs
                 "$packages/../stubs",
                 // project's stubs
                 "$folder/typings",
                 // the followings come from the default settings
                 "$sublime_py_files_dir",
                 "$packages",
             ],
         },
     }
     ```

1. Restart your ST and happy coding â™¥
