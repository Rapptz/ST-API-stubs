# Sublime Text API Stubs

With LSP proper configured, you can have something like the following screenshot.

## How to Use

I personally use this with [LSP][pc-lsp] + [LSP-pyright][pc-lsp-pyright] / [LSP-pylance][private-lsp-pylance] setup.

1. Install the [LSP][pc-lsp] package via Package Control.
1. You have to copy those `.pyi` stub files from this repository to `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/typings/` directory.
1. Make your preferred LSP server able to "see" them.

   - If you use [LSP-pyright][pc-lsp-pyright] / [LSP-pylance][private-lsp-pylance],
     configure the `python.analysis.extraPaths`:

     ```js
     {
         "settings": {
             "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
                 // my custom stubs
                 "$packages/../typings",
                 // project's stubs
                 "$folder/typings",
             ],
         },
         // a special predefined setup for developing ST plugins
         "dev_environment": "sublime_text",
     }
     ```

   - If you use [LSP-pyls][gh-lsp-pysl], configure the `pyls.plugins.jedi.extra_paths`:

     ```js
     {
         "settings": {
             "pyls.plugins.jedi.extra_paths": [
                 // my custom stubs
                 "$packages/../typings",
                 // project's stubs
                 "$folder/typings",
             ],
         },
     }
     ```

1. Restart your ST and happy coding â™¥
